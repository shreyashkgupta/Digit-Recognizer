# Digit Recognizer
Convolutional Neural Network for Recognizing Handwritten Digits

Aim:
The aim of the "Digit Recognizer" project is to build a prediction model that can predict the value of handwritten digits.

Input set:
The training data set has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

Output set:
For each of the 28000 images in the test set, there is a single line containing the ImageId and the digit predicted by the model.

Approach:
This project uses the Convolutional Neural Network approach to build the prediction model.
The CNN model is implemented using the Keras module.
